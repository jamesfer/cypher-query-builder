A flexible and intuitive query builder for Neo4j and Cypher.
Write queries in Javascript just as you would write them in Cypher.

- Easy to use fluent interface
- Support for streaming records using observables
- Full Typescript declarations included in package

```javascript
let results = await db
  .matchNode("user", "User", { active: true })
  .where({ "user.age": greaterThan(18) })
  .with("user")
  .create([
    cypher.node("user", ""),
    cypher.relation("out", "", "HasVehicle"),
    cypher.node("vehicle", "Vehicle", { colour: "red" }),
  ])
  .ret(["user", "vehicle"])
  .run();

// Results:
// [{
//   user: {
//     identity: 1234,
//     labels: [ 'User' ],
//     properties: { ... },
//   },
//   vehicle: {
//     identity: 4321,
//     labels: [ 'Vehicle' ],
//     properties: { ... },
//   },
// }]
```

## Quick start

### Installation

```
npm install --save cypher-query-builder
```

or

```
yarn add cypher-query-builder
```

### Importing

CommonJS/Node

```javascript
const cypher = require("cypher-query-builder");
// cypher.Connection
// cypher.greaterThan
// ....
```

ES6

```javascript
import { Connection, greaterThan } from "cypher-query-builder";
```

### Connecting

```javascript
const cypher = require("cypher-query-builder");

// Make sure to include the protocol in the hostname
let db = new cypher.Connection("bolt://localhost", {
  username: "root",
  password: "password",
});
```

Cypher query builder uses the official Neo4j Nodejs driver over the bolt
protocol in the background so you can pass any values into connection that
are accepted by that driver.

### Querying

ES6

```javascript
db.matchNode("projects", "Project")
  .return("projects")
  .run()
  .then(function (results) {
    // Do something with results
  });
```

ES2017

```javascript
const results = await db
  .matchNode("projects", "Project")
  .return("projects")
  .run();
```

`run` will execute the query and return a promise. The results are in the
_standardish_ Neo4j form an array of records:

```javascript
const results = [
  {
    projects: {
      // Internal Neo4j node id, don't rely on this to stay constant.
      identity: 1,

      // All labels attached to the node
      labels: ["Project"],

      // Actual properties of the node.
      // Note that Neo4j numbers will automatically be converted to
      // Javascript numbers. This may cause issues because Neo4j can
      // store larger numbers than can be represented in Javascript.
      // This behaviour is currently in consideration and may change
      // in the future.
      properties: { name: "Project 1" },
    },
  },
  // ...
];
```

You can also use the `stream` method to download the results as an observable.

```javascript
const results = db.matchNode("project", "Project").ret("project").stream();

results.subscribe((row) => console.log(row.project.properties.name));
```

### Processing

To extract the results, you can use ES5 array methods or a library like lodash:

```javascript
// Get all the project nodes (including their id, labels and properties).
let projects = results.map((row) => row.projects);

// Get just the properties of the nodes
let projectProps = results.map((row) => row.projects.properties);
```

## Documentation

All the reference documentation can be found [here](http://jamesfer.me/cypher-query-builder).
However, the two most useful pages are probably:

- The [Connection](https://jamesfer.me/cypher-query-builder/classes/connection.html) class, for
  details on creating and using a connection.
- The [Query](https://jamesfer.me/cypher-query-builder/classes/query.html) class, for details on
  all the available clauses, and building and running queries.

## Contributing

Please feel free to submit any bugs or questions you may have in an
[issue](https://github.com/jamesfer/cypher-query-builder/issues). I'm very open to discussing
suggestions or new ideas so don't hesitate to reach out.

Maintaining the library does take some time out of my schedule so if you'd like to show your
appreciation please consider donating. Even the smallest amount is really encouraging.
